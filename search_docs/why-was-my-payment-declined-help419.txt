If your payment is being
    declined, here are the most common reasons: Your payment was
            declined by your bank or card issuer. To protect your privacy, your card issuer or bank doesn't tell PayPal why
        your card was declined. Contact your card issuer or bank for more information. Your card details are
            outdated. Update the expiration date or billing address associated with your credit or debit card. Your PayPal account is
            limited. Resolve a limitation placed on your account. You need to go through a
            security check. To deliver a secure
        service, we may ask you to confirm your identity . We do this to make sure it's you using the PayPal account. You haven’t confirmed
            the email address associated with PayPal. Confirm your email address now. You haven’t confirmed
            your bank account. You need to confirm your bank account before you can use it to make payments. You may be required to
            confirm your card. If a “Confirm Card”
        link appears next to your card details, you’ll need to confirm this debit or credit card before using it with PayPal. This step helps to make sure
        that the card is valid and belongs to you. If none of the above
    apply or if you continue having issues with your payment: Change your payment
            method. You can add a debit or credit card or add a bank account . Confirm the recipient’s
            information. Make sure the recipient
        has finished registering for PayPal and you have their correct email address or
        phone number. If your withdrawal is
