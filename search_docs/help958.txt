PayPal Rewards is PayPal’s rewards program that lets you earn points when you take advantage of offers available to you when you use PayPal and PayPal Honey (“Honey”) features. Once you’ve earned points, you can apply them towards purchases while using PayPal checkout or redeem them for cash back or a charitable donation. Do I need to sign up for PayPal Rewards? Is there a fee? If you have a PayPal account, you’re eligible to start earning PayPal Rewards right away on eligible transactions. There's no additional sign up or enrollment needed, and there’s no cost to join. What are PayPal Rewards points and how do I earn them? PayPal Rewards are points you earn when you purchase eligible items from offers on the PayPal app, PayPal.com , and the PayPal Honey browser extension. Points are generally earned on the subtotal amounts of eligible items you purchase and may exclude other amounts like taxes and shipping fees. Keep in mind that exclusions may apply, so read any exclusions carefully. Shopping isn’t the only way to earn points. You can also earn points by completing other activities using PayPal. Go to the PayPal app to view available ways to earn. How can I redeem PayPal Rewards points? Visit the PayPal app or website to see available redemption options and redeem your PayPal Rewards points. Where can I see my earned and pending PayPal Rewards points? You can keep track of your points balance, see your past PayPal Rewards activity, and redeem your points in the PayPal app or online. How long does it take for my points to show up in my PayPal Rewards balance? Points will appear as pending in your account overview within 1-14 days of completing your qualifying purchase or incentivized activity. Points will remain pending for up to 90 days and cannot be used or redeemed during this time. Travel-related points (such as points earned from eligible hotel reservations, airfare, or rental cars) may take longer. Once points are ready to redeem, we’ll send you a confirmation email. You will also be able to see in your Rewards dashboard when points are no longer pending and are available to redeem. How much are PayPal Rewards points worth? Points cannot be purchased, are not your property, are not money, can expire, and have no value prior to redemption. While points may be redeemed for cash back, other redemption options are available. You are not required to redeem your points for cash back. When redeeming, PayPal Reward points typically equate to $0.01 per point,. For example, 100 points typically can be redeemed for $1 of cash back. We may offer different rewards conversion rates. Check the conversion rate at the time you redeem your points. Do PayPal Rewards points expire? Points can expire. Learn more about how points expire (and how to prevent expiration) . Will I earn PayPal Reward points if I return a purchase? You will not earn points for any item that you return or receive a full refund on. If you return all or part of your purchase or receive a refund on it, the number of points you receive on your purchase will be reduced based on the new subtotal of eligible items, regardless of pending status.
