To provide a secure
    online payment service, our system reviews every transfer before it's released.
    We may hold some withdrawals for up to 72 hours for further review. This review
    can happen for various reasons. For example, we may review the transfer if
    you’ve received a higher-than-usual payment or if you’ve logged in from an
    unsecured network. When the transfer passes review, you’ll see the status
    update to “Completed.” The
regular transfer timeframe will then take effect.
