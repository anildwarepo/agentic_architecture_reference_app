When API calls are made to the NVP/SOAP and REST servers, we recommend using Domain Name Service (DNS) results with default Time To Live (TTL) values to determine IP addresses of our servers. We do not recommend adding IP addresses to an allow list. If you must add to an allow list, use the following ranges that are applicable to Live and Sandbox endpoints.: 64.4.240.0/21 64.4.248.0/22 66.211.168.0/22 91.243.72.0/23 173.0.80.0/20 185.177.52.0/22 192.160.215.0/24 198.54.216.0/23 At least one of the IP addresses listed above will be serving traffic for each system. Your application must know how to cycle through all the address ranges until it locates one that is functioning.
