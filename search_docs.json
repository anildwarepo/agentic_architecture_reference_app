Before you begin A limited account means that you won’t be able to do certain things with your PayPal account. For example, you might not be able to send or withdraw money. Usually, we ask you to complete some steps to remove your account limitation. Go to your Resolution Center or click the bell icon at the top of your Dashboard for more info. If all the steps are completed and your account remains limited, it either means: We've already reviewed your account and sent you an email asking for more information. We're still reviewing the information you provided. If you're required to upload documents, review our tips for submitting documents . The time it takes to resolve an account limitation depends on the complexity of your specific case. In most cases, our customer service team can't remove your limitation over the phone. Please wait for us to contact you. If you received an email stating your account is limited, but don't see a limitation in the Resolution Center , you may have received a fake email. Forward it to phishing@paypal.com and we'll investigate it for you. After you forward us the email, delete it from your inbox. If you clicked any links or downloaded any attachments, log in to your account and view your payments. It's also a good idea to change your password.

PayPal Rewards is PayPal’s rewards program that lets you earn points when you take advantage of offers available to you when you use PayPal and PayPal Honey (“Honey”) features. Once you’ve earned points, you can apply them towards purchases while using PayPal checkout or redeem them for cash back or a charitable donation. Do I need to sign up for PayPal Rewards? Is there a fee? If you have a PayPal account, you’re eligible to start earning PayPal Rewards right away on eligible transactions. There's no additional sign up or enrollment needed, and there’s no cost to join. What are PayPal Rewards points and how do I earn them? PayPal Rewards are points you earn when you purchase eligible items from offers on the PayPal app, PayPal.com , and the PayPal Honey browser extension. Points are generally earned on the subtotal amounts of eligible items you purchase and may exclude other amounts like taxes and shipping fees. Keep in mind that exclusions may apply, so read any exclusions carefully. Shopping isn’t the only way to earn points. You can also earn points by completing other activities using PayPal. Go to the PayPal app to view available ways to earn. How can I redeem PayPal Rewards points? Visit the PayPal app or website to see available redemption options and redeem your PayPal Rewards points. Where can I see my earned and pending PayPal Rewards points? You can keep track of your points balance, see your past PayPal Rewards activity, and redeem your points in the PayPal app or online. How long does it take for my points to show up in my PayPal Rewards balance? Points will appear as pending in your account overview within 1-14 days of completing your qualifying purchase or incentivized activity. Points will remain pending for up to 90 days and cannot be used or redeemed during this time. Travel-related points (such as points earned from eligible hotel reservations, airfare, or rental cars) may take longer. Once points are ready to redeem, we’ll send you a confirmation email. You will also be able to see in your Rewards dashboard when points are no longer pending and are available to redeem. How much are PayPal Rewards points worth? Points cannot be purchased, are not your property, are not money, can expire, and have no value prior to redemption. While points may be redeemed for cash back, other redemption options are available. You are not required to redeem your points for cash back. When redeeming, PayPal Reward points typically equate to $0.01 per point,. For example, 100 points typically can be redeemed for $1 of cash back. We may offer different rewards conversion rates. Check the conversion rate at the time you redeem your points. Do PayPal Rewards points expire? Points can expire. Learn more about how points expire (and how to prevent expiration) . Will I earn PayPal Reward points if I return a purchase? You will not earn points for any item that you return or receive a full refund on. If you return all or part of your purchase or receive a refund on it, the number of points you receive on your purchase will be reduced based on the new subtotal of eligible items, regardless of pending status. What happened to my PayPal Gold points? PayPal Gold is now PayPal Rewards. If you had a PayPal Gold points balance, your points have been automatically converted to PayPal Rewards. You can check and manage your points balance in the PayPal app or online . Can I earn PayPal Rewards points and my credit card rewards together? Yes, purchases you make using a points-eligible credit card with PayPal are eligible to earn credit card points, in accordance with the terms of your card issuer’s points program. You can also earn PayPal Rewards points for the same transaction if purchasing an eligible item from offers on the PayPal app , PayPal.com , or the PayPal Honey browser extension. Can I use PayPal Rewards points and my credit card rewards together at checkout? At this time, you are not able to use both PayPal Rewards points and your credit card points in the same PayPal transaction. Can I earn PayPal Rewards points on my PayPal Debit Card purchases? Yes, you can earn PayPal Rewards on eligible PayPal Debit Card purchases when you checkout with PayPal. Learn more about the PayPal Debit Card 5% monthly cash back category rewards .

To convert your PEM certificate to a PKCS12 certificate, use a third-party tool. PayPal recommends OpenSSL, which you can download at www.openssl.org . The following instructions assume that you retain the default certificate filename of \"cert_key_pem.txt.\" Before you begin, note the following: Windows users – If you get an error saying “openssl is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file,” this means that openssl is not in your PATH. To resolve this, either add the directory that contains the OpenSSL binary to your system PATH or save your PEM certificate file in the directory where the OpenSSL binary is. Depending on where you’ve installed OpenSSL, you should find the OpenSSL binary (openssl.exe) in the OpenSSL installation bin folder. UNIX users – These instructions are Windows-centric. Most UNIX hosts have OpenSSL already installed. If you’re on a UNIX host, the command to convert the PEM to a .p12 file is the same as for Windows. Check to see if you have OpenSSL by typing openssl at the command line and pressing Enter. If you get anything other than an error indicating that OpenSSL can’t be found, your machine likely has OpenSSL already installed and you can try running the command in Step 2. 1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory that contains the cert_key_pem.txt file. 2. Execute the following OpenSSL command to create a PKCS12 (.p12) file: openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey cert_key_pem.txt -in cert_key_pem.txt -out cert_key.p12 Note: To convert a PKCS12 certificate to PEM, use the following command: openssl pkcs12 -in cert_key.p12 -out cert_key.pem -nodes 3. After you enter the command, you'll be prompted to enter an Export Password. Choose a password or phrase and note the value you enter ( PayPal Developer documentation calls this the \"private key password.\") 4. A file called cert_key.p12 is created in this directory. This is your .p12 file.

Usually, we ask you to complete some steps to remove your account limitation. Go to your Resolution Center or click the bell icon at the top of your Dashboard for more info. If all the steps are completed and your account remains limited, it either means: We've already reviewed your account and sent you an email asking for more information. We're still reviewing the information you provided. If you're required to upload documents, review our tips for submitting documents . The time it takes to resolve an account limitation depends on the complexity of your specific case. In most cases, our customer service team can't remove your limitation over the phone. Please wait for us to contact you. If you received an email stating your account is limited, but don't see a limitation in the Resolution Center , you may have received a fake email. Forward it to phishing@paypal.com and we'll investigate it for you. After you forward us the email, delete it from your inbox.

Can I cancel a payment? Canceling a completed payment immediately is generally not an option because the other party already has the money. Contacting the seller is usually the best way to resolve a problem. You can find their contact details by going to your Activity and selecting the payment. They may be able to issue a refund or help with a return. Otherwise, you can file a dispute within the correct dispute-filing timeframe . Here's how to open a dispute on the web: Go to the Resolution Center . Click Report a Problem . Select the payment and click Continue . Select the reason for your dispute, such as: I didn’t receive the item purchased. The product or service is not as described. I have a billing issue Add any relevant information and click Submit . To open a dispute on the app: Go to Activity and tap the transaction you want to report. Scroll to the bottom and tap Report a Problem . Select the type of issue you have, including any relevant details, and tap Submit . In a dispute, you can message the seller through PayPal to try to resolve any issues. If you cannot resolve the dispute, you have 20 days to escalate the dispute to a claim. In a claim, we investigate the case and decide the outcome. You can check the progress of a dispute or claim at any time in your Resolution Center .

An automatic payment, also known as a subscription, billing agreement, or recurring payment, authorizes a merchant to charge you without signing in to your PayPal account. You can set up an automatic payment with a merchant during checkout and the terms are available to view in your PayPal account afterwards. For more information on automatic payments, please visit our user agreement . Here’s how to find your automatic payments on the PayPal website: Go to Settings . Click Payments . Select Subscriptions and saved businesses . Select the merchant. On this page, you can cancel the automatic payment and change the backup payment method. Most automatic payments allow you to assign a specific payment method when you set them up. It means that this specific payment method will be prioritized for making the relevant automatic payment, even if you’ve chosen a different card or bank as your preferred way to make general payments with PayPal. Here's how to change the payment method for automatic payment: Select your current payment method. Select a new payment method or click L ink a new card or bank. Click Save. Contact information for your merchant can be found in the automatic payment. To update your automatic payment method on the app: Tap Accounts . Tap Subscriptions and saved businesses . Tap the merchant to view or update. You can update your preferred payment method. To remove a payment method on the app: Tap Accounts . Tap Subscriptions and saved businesses .

You can create test versions of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Maestro, or JCB credit cards.  You can also find a list of credit card numbers in our developer documentation . Test credit card numbers are used in the PayPal Sandbox to validate the authorization, capture, and credit transaction flows. Because test credit cards don't include a card verification code (CVV), you can use 123 as the CVV for Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and Diners Club, or 1234 as the CVV for American Express.

If you get error code 10002 using PayPal’s APIs, it's usually because of incorrect API Credentials or API permissions for third-party calls. Third-Party API Calls To allow a third-party to make API calls on your behalf, you must grant them permission. If you've already done this but got error code 10002, your shopping cart configuration may be the cause. Your shopping cart provider needs to know the primary email address on the PayPal account for which they're making the third-party API call, and they must add this email address to the API script.

If your payment is being\n    declined, here are the most common reasons: Your payment was\n            declined by your bank or card issuer. To protect your privacy, your card issuer or bank doesn't tell PayPal why\n        your card was declined. Contact your card issuer or bank for more information. Your card details are\n            outdated. Update the expiration date or billing address associated with your credit or debit card. Your PayPal account is\n            limited. Resolve a limitation placed on your account. You need to go through a\n            security check. To deliver a secure\n        service, we may ask you to confirm your identity . We do this to make sure it's you using the PayPal account. You haven’t confirmed\n            the email address associated with PayPal. Confirm your email address now. You haven’t confirmed\n            your bank account. You need to confirm your bank account before you can use it to make payments. You may be required to\n            confirm your card. If a “Confirm Card”\n        link appears next to your card details, you’ll need to confirm this debit or credit card before using it with PayPal. This step helps to make sure\n        that the card is valid and belongs to you. If none of the above\n    apply or if you continue having issues with your payment: Change your payment\n            method. You can add a debit or credit card or add a bank account . Confirm the recipient’s\n            information. Make sure the recipient\n        has finished registering for PayPal and you have their correct email address or\n        phone number.
